<h1>Wide Angle Agile</h1>

<p>Wide Angle Agile reframes core priorities for regulated environments, inspired by the Agile Manifesto:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Integrated compliance over end-of-project remediation</strong>
    Compliance is not a phase or a checkpoint—it is part of the daily workflow.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Continuous risk management over delayed risk documentation</strong>
    Risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated as designs evolve, not after they are finalized.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stakeholder-ready documentation over sprint-only outputs</strong>
    Documentation exists to support decisions, audits, and patient safety—not just velocity.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adaptable structure over rigid frameworks</strong>
    Processes, tools, and ceremonies evolve based on what works for a unique team in a regulated context.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cross-functional ownership over functional handoffs</strong>
    Engineering, regulatory, and clinical partners share responsibility for outcomes from day one.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Audit readiness over audit panic</strong>
    Traceability and design controls are maintained continuously, not reconstructed under pressure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Learning-driven iteration over blind speed</strong>
    Iteration is purposeful, informed by data, risk, and regulatory constraints—not motion for motion’s sake.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Both sides matter—but in regulated product development, the left is often the constraint that determines success.</p>
